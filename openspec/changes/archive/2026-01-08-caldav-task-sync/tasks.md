# Tasks: CalDAV Task Synchronization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-caldav-task-sync/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/caldav-api.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Not requested in feature specification - focusing on implementation tasks only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

-   **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
-   **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5, US6)
-   Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Single Obsidian plugin project structure at repository root:

-   `src/` - Source code
-   `tests/` - Test files (for future use)
-   `manifest.json`, `package.json` - Configuration files

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

-   [x] T001 Install dependencies from package.json: tsdav, typescript@5.8.3+, esbuild, vitest
-   [x] T002 [P] Configure TypeScript compiler in tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled
-   [x] T003 [P] Create src/ directory structure with subdirectories: caldav/, sync/, vault/, ui/
-   [x] T004 [P] Create base TypeScript interfaces in src/types.ts for Task, SyncMapping, CalDAVConfiguration, CalDAVTask, TaskStatus, VTODOStatus enums
-   [x] T005 [P] Update manifest.json with plugin metadata: id, name, version, minAppVersion, description, isDesktopOnly: false
-   [x] T006 Verify build process works: npm run build produces main.js

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

---

## Phase 7: User Story 3 - Update Synced Tasks from CalDAV to Obsidian (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Pull task modifications from CalDAV server back into Obsidian vault

**Independent Test**: Sync a task, modify it on CalDAV server (using any CalDAV client), wait for next automatic sync in Obsidian, verify changes appear in vault

---

## Phase 8: User Story 6 - Configure Sync Filters (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Allow users to control which tasks sync based on folder paths, tags, and completed task age

**Independent Test**: Configure filters (exclude "Archive/" folder, exclude "#private" tag, set 30-day threshold), create matching and non-matching tasks, verify only appropriate tasks sync

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
-   **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
    -   US4 (Configure CalDAV) - Can start after Foundational (required for all sync operations)
    -   US5 (Configure Auto-Sync) - Can start after Foundational (required for automatic sync)
    -   US1 (Initial Sync) - Depends on US4, US5 (needs connection and scheduler)
    -   US2 (Update Obsidian→CalDAV) - Depends on US1 (extends initial sync)
    -   US3 (Update CalDAV→Obsidian) - Depends on US1 (extends initial sync, can be parallel with US2)
    -   US6 (Filters) - Can integrate into US1/US2 once basic sync works
-   **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

```
Phase 2 (Foundational)
    ↓
    ├─→ US4 (Configure CalDAV Connection) ─┐
    └─→ US5 (Configure Auto-Sync Interval) ─┤
                                             ↓
                                    US1 (Initial Sync) ─┬─→ US2 (Update Obsidian→CalDAV)
                                             ↓          │
                                    US6 (Filters) ◀────┴─→ US3 (Update CalDAV→Obsidian)
```

**Critical Path for MVP**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → US4 → US5 → US1 (T001-T045)

### Within Each User Story

-   Settings UI before sync logic (US4, US5, US6)
-   Scanner/Parser before sync engine (US1)
-   Basic CRUD before change detection (US1 before US2/US3)
-   CalDAV client methods before sync engine usage
-   Error handling integrated throughout

### Parallel Opportunities

-   **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003, T004, T005 can run in parallel (different files)
-   **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T008, T009, T010, T011 can run in parallel (different modules)
-   **US4 (Configure CalDAV)**: T014 (UI) can run parallel with T019 (client), then integrate at T020-T023
-   **US5 (Auto-Sync)**: T024-T026 (UI) can run parallel with T027 (scheduler)
-   **US1 (Initial Sync)**: T033, T034 (vault) can run parallel with T037 (VTODO conversion)
-   **US2 (Update)**: T046 (detection) can run parallel with T047 (CalDAV update method)
-   **US3 (Bidirectional)**: T052, T053 (CalDAV fetching/parsing) can run parallel with T055 (vault writer)
-   **US6 (Filters)**: T061-T064 (UI) can run parallel with T065-T067 (filter logic)
-   **Polish (Phase 9)**: T072-T082 can run in parallel (different concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Initial Sync)

```bash
# Launch vault scanning and parsing together:
Task T033: "Implement vault scanner in src/vault/scanner.ts"
Task T034: "Implement task parser in src/vault/taskParser.ts"

# While those are in progress, also work on:
Task T037: "Implement VTODO converter in src/caldav/vtodo.ts"

# These three can be developed independently and integrated later in T040
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 6 (Filters)

```bash
# Launch UI work in parallel with filter logic:
Task T061-T064: "Add filter settings UI in src/ui/settingsTab.ts"

# While UI is being built, implement filter methods:
Task T065: "Folder exclusion check in src/sync/filters.ts"
Task T066: "Tag exclusion check in src/sync/filters.ts"
Task T067: "Age threshold check in src/sync/filters.ts"

# These can be developed independently and integrated at T068-T069
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

1. ✅ Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T006)
2. ✅ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T007-T013) - CRITICAL BLOCKER
3. ✅ Complete US4: Configure CalDAV Connection (T014-T023)
4. ✅ Complete US5: Configure Auto-Sync Interval (T024-T032)
5. ✅ Complete US1: Initial Task Sync (T033-T045)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test MVP independently with real CalDAV server
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: At this point, users can configure CalDAV connection, set sync interval, and sync tasks from Obsidian to CalDAV automatically. This is a complete, valuable feature.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **MVP Release** (P1 stories: US4, US5, US1): Basic one-way sync with auto-sync
2. **Update Release** (Add US2): Enable Obsidian task updates to flow to CalDAV
3. **Bidirectional Release** (Add US3): Full bidirectional sync
4. **Filter Release** (Add US6): Advanced filtering capabilities
5. **Polish Release** (Phase 9): Production-ready with error handling and optimization

Each release adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

1. **Team completes Setup + Foundational together** (T001-T013)
2. Once Foundational is done:
    - **Developer A**: US4 (Configure CalDAV) → T014-T023
    - **Developer B**: US5 (Configure Auto-Sync) → T024-T032 (can start parallel to A)
    - **Developer A+B**: US1 (Initial Sync) → T033-T045 (requires both US4 and US5)
3. After US1 MVP:
    - **Developer A**: US2 (Update Obsidian→CalDAV) → T046-T051
    - **Developer B**: US3 (Update CalDAV→Obsidian) → T052-T060
    - **Developer C**: US6 (Filters) → T061-T071 (can start parallel to A/B)
4. All converge on Phase 9: Polish
